    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the practice of bundling an object's data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, or class. This encapsulation hides the internal state of an object and exposes a well-defined interface for interacting with it. It helps in data protection and ensures that the object's state is modified in a controlled manner.\n",
